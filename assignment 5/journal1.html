	<p> Waking up and realizing you don't have to go to school is pretty awesome. But realizing that you only have one class isn't. Regardless, I was able to spend more time with my friends. Whether it was playing video games, playing in the snow, watching UMass basketball, or just hanging out, we had fun doing all kinds of activities. </p>

	<p> I woke up around 9 this morning to go to the gym at 10. At the recreation center I worked on my chest, back, legs, triceps, and biceps. I finished around 11 and had lunch at the hatch. I managed to get most of my friends to purchase and play one of my favorite games: Borderlands 2. Before that, I played a game of Super Smash Brothers Melee with my RA. Such a great game; such a classic. By the end of the day my body was sore. </p>

	<p> I woke up pretty late despite sleeping early last night. I spent almost half the day doing homework. Doing ridiculous amounts of homework for English 391, History 101, and English 381 is always fun. At 8 I went to dinner with my friends, and finished off the night with the Walking Dead at 9. </p>
